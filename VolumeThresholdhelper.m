function [] = VolumeThresholdhelper(fileName)
%% VolumeThresholdhelper Information
% VolumeThresholdhelper is used to help the user find parameters to use for 
% batch processing with LC3B_Tandem_Puncta_QuantificationV2. The function 
% takes in the fileName of a file in the current directory. It then asks the 
% user to input parameters.
% 
% Function asks the user to enter the following information which is used for 
% thresholding and identifying the cell boundaries. Three GUIs will be opened 
% for the user to do this. 
% 
% Three GUIs propompted to the user are:
% 
% 1.Asks the user to input integers in the range [1,3]  which is used to specify
% the order for the cell markers. This is, the channels for the nuclear 
% marker, eGFP vacuoles and mCherry vacuoles. 
% 
% 2.Asks the user to input integers which are used to threshold the mature 
% eGFP and mCherry vacuoles. Code assumes images are 16-bit so inputs should 
% be in the range of [0, 65535] which specifies the intensity value for 
% unit16 arrays. 
% 
% 3.Asks the user to input approximate volume sizes, in voxels, for the 
% nuclear marker, eGFP vacuoles, mCherry vacuoles and the solidity for the 
% vacuoles which is type float between [0,1].
% 
% Once the parameters are input by the user, the function will use the inputs 
% to label  each slice in the image data with yellow circles wherever it 
% identifies a vacuole and presents the volume data using sliceViewer with 
% the yellow circles overlaid for the users to check if the parameters worked 
% or should be adjusted. A dialogue box is presented for the user to enter 
% Y/N if they would like to try other parameters to improve the segmentation.
% Once satisfied the user can enter N and proceed to see what the Ridgelines 
% and single cell containers look like to verify the SNR is high enough to 
% perform segmentation with Otsuâ€™s method. Finally, subplots for the single 
% cell data with the nuclear marker, eGFP and mCherry vacuoles are presented 
% for viewing as isosurface plots. Note: user should place waitfor() after 
% figures to stop the function at each plot for viewing in the functions 
% WatershedOberserver and IsosurfaceVacuoles. 
% 
% Once the user has identified appropriate parameters for their data they can
% use the parameters in LC3B_Tandem_Puncta_QuantificationV2 to perform batch 
% processing for their data.
